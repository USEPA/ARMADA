State,Narrative
Alabama,"The Alabama Department of Environmental Management is tasked with assessing the State's abundant surface water resources to include lakes, reservoirs, rivers, streams, wetlands, coastal waters, and estuaries. With over 129,700 miles of perennial and intermittent streams and rivers, 425,748 acres of publicly-owned lakes and reservoirs, 610 square miles of estuaries, and 337 miles of coastal shoreline (including bays and inlets), the state is faced with a tremendous challenge to monitor and accurately report on the condition of its surface waters. Alabama's assessment and listing methodology establishes a process, consistent with EPA's guidance, to assess the status of surface waters in Alabama relative to the designated uses assigned to each waterbody. The water quality assessment process begins with the collection, compilation, and evaluation of water quality data and information for the purpose of determining if a waterbody is supporting all of its designated uses. The goal is to accurately describe the status of surface waters where possible and to identify waters where more information is needed to make use support decisions. Ultimately, the Department strives to conserve the waters of the State and to protect, maintain, and improve the quality thereof for public water supplies, for the propagation of wildlife, fish, and aquatic life and for domestic, agricultural, industrial, recreational, and other legitimate beneficial uses."
Alaska,"Alaska has more water in the form of lakes, streams, rivers, coastline and wetlands than any other state in the union. Nearly half of the total surface waters of the United States are located within Alaska. Currently, less than 10% of Alaska’s waters have been assessed by the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (ADEC). However, because of the state’s geographic size, sparse population, and remote character, the vast majority of its water resources are likely in near-pristine condition. In Alaska, surface water sources supply fresh water for three-fourths of the water needed for industry, agriculture, mining, fish processing and public water use. Surface water is also the source for about half of the domestic water supply. Alaska surface waters include tens of thousands of salmon streams, which are an important resource for Alaskans and the world. ADEC is responsible for protecting human health and the environment in this vast and water-rich state. More information on Alaska’s water quality can be found at http://dec.alaska.gov/water.aspx"
Arizona,Arizona is one of the driest states in the union. Only 3% of Arizona’s streams flow year round. The other 97% flow only part of the year or in response to storms. Almost all of the lakes in Arizona have been artificially created by dams. Water in the desert is a precious commodity for humans and the environment. It is the Arizona Department of Environmental Quality’s mission to protect and enhance public health and the environment in Arizona. More information about Arizona’s water quality can be found at https://azdeq.gov/programs/water-quality-programs/surface-water-monitoring-and-assessment.
Arkansas,"The Arkansas Department of Energy and Environment, Division of Environmental Quality (DEQ) is the agency tasked with implementing the monitoring, assessment, and reporting requirements of the Federal Clean Water Act (CWA). The Integrated Report (IR) describes the status of the state’s surface waters, as required by the CWA and is developed every two years. The report is an evaluation and summary of physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of waters of the state. For the IR, Arkansas evaluates water quality data collected by multiple entities, including: DEQ; other state, federal, and local government agencies; and private entities. Evaluated data must have been collected and analyzed under a Quality Assurance Project Plan that meets or exceeds DEQ’s quality assurance/quality control protocols. Monitoring data are used to not only assess waterbodies, but also to inform permit decisions, develop Total Maximum Daily Loads, and to assist in the development of water quality criteria. Arkansas’s water quality standards are found in Rule 2, Rule Establishing Water Quality Standards for Surface Waters of the State of Arkansas."
California,"The State Water Resources Control Board and the nine Regional Water Quality Control Boards, collectively known as the California Water Boards, are dedicated to a single vision: a sustainable California made possible by clean water and water availability for both human uses and environmental resource protection. Under the federal Clean Water Act and the state’s pioneering Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act, the California Water Boards have regulatory responsibility for protecting the water quality of nearly 1.6 million acres of lakes, 1.3 million acres of bays and estuaries, 211,000 miles of rivers and streams, and 1,100 miles of exquisite California coastline"
Colorado,"In Colorado, there are nearly 93,000 miles of rivers and more than 270,000 acres of lakes. The majority of rivers originate in the pristine high alpine environment of the Rocky Mountains and flow downstream through the high desert or high plains regions before leaving the state. Nearly half of the state is flat in contrast to Colorado’s rugged Rocky Mountains. Numerous dams and reclamation projects on the rivers provide water for irrigation and municipal and industrial use, as well as supply hydroelectric power. Colorado has divided the state into seven major river basins and employs a rotating basin strategy that targets a different basin each year. Colorado's water quality assessments also follow this rotating basin approach, which ensures that all basins in the state are assessed at least once every five years. The major river basins of Colorado are the: Arkansas, Rio Grande, San Juan, Colorado, Green, South Platte, and Republican. The largest of these basins on a national level is the Colorado River Basin, which has its headwaters in Rocky Mountain National Park, flows from Colorado through Utah and the Grand Canyon in Arizona, and ultimately completes its journey at the Gulf of California. Colorado assesses it surface waters to be protective of their uses. Classified uses are assigned to waterbodies based upon the actual uses occurring in the waterbody. Water quality standards are in place to ensure that the waterbody is attaining the classified uses assigned. These uses have been adopted as follows: aquatic life, water supply, recreation, wetlands and agriculture."
Connecticut,
Florida,"The Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) works with many different programs and agencies throughout the state to address issues and problems affecting surface water and groundwater quality and quantity. These responsibilities are implemented through a variety of activities, including planning, regulation, watershed management, the assessment and application of water quality standards, nonpoint source pollution management, ambient water quality monitoring, groundwater protection, educational programs, and land management. Florida also relies upon a host of monitoring organizations—including water management districts, local governments, universities, and volunteer citizen scientists—to provide high quality water quality data. Taken together with the department's strategic and status monitoring programs, Florida has substantially more monitoring stations and water quality data than any other state in the nation. The department historically assessed these data to evaluate waterbody health in the state on a five-year rotating schedule; however, is now implementing a new approach to evaluate all waterbodies on a biennial schedule. These efforts allow us to understand the state's water conditions, make decisions that further enhance our waterways, and focus our efforts on addressing problems. We encourage all those interested in Florida's waterways to visit our webpage, gain a better understanding of Florida’s water quality conditions, and engage in local efforts to protect and restore water quality."
Iowa,"The Iowa Department of Natural Resources Water Quality Monitoring and Assessment Section compiles the impaired water list, or 303(d) listing. The 303(d) listing is composed of those lakes, wetlands, streams, rivers, and portions of rivers that do not meet all state water quality standards. Iowa’s Section 303(d) list (Category 5 of the Integrated Report) is developed under Iowa's Credible Data Law. This law, passed by the Iowa Legislature in 2000, requires that listing decisions be based on scientifically valid chemical, physical, or biological data collected under a scientifically accepted sampling and analysis plan, including quality control and quality assurance procedures."
Kansas,"Kansas assesses and monitors ambient water quality to evaluate the attainment of water quality standards through targeted monitoring survey designs that focus on selected stream reaches, lakes, and wetlands. Assessments for streams are conducted on a watershed basis, where stream station assessments are associated with the stream reaches in the contributing watershed. The targeted stream chemistry monitoring network consists of 329 sampling stations and generates physical, chemical, radiological, and microbiological data useful in the characterization of pollutant loadings from more than 97 percent of the state’s contributing drainage area. Information derived from this network is applied in the development of total maximum daily loads (TMDLs) for water quality-limited streams and in the formulation of water quality-based permit limits for facilities discharging treated effluent to the waters of the state. Another targeted program, the stream biological monitoring program, evaluates the pollution-tolerance of benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages at approximately 180 locations in Kansas. Information from this program enhances the department’s ability to detect water pollution problems, identify contaminants of concern, and develop defensible TMDLs and wastewater treatment plant permits. Kansas also routinely surveys 188 publicly owned (or publicly accessible) lakes and wetlands. Physicochemical and biological data generated by this program are applied in the development of TMDLs and water quality-based permit limits, the resolution of toxic algal blooms and algal-related taste and odor problems, the characterization of lake trophic condition, and the tracking and prediction of long-term trends in surface water quality."
Massachusetts,"The Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MassDEP) is responsible for assessing the health of surface waters (rivers, lakes, and coastal waters) across the Commonwealth. To enable water quality assessments and listing of impaired waters, ambient monitoring data (for both targeted and statistical surveys) are collected by Watershed Planning Program staff, other state and federal agency partners, and numerous watershed and stakeholder monitoring groups to characterize the biological, physical, and chemical conditions of surface waterbodies statewide.?The Massachusetts surface water quality standards (SWQS) identify designated uses, such as Fish, other Aquatic Life and Wildlife (Aquatic Life), Fish Consumption (Eating Fish), Aesthetics (Other), Shellfish Harvesting (Eating Fish), Public Water Supply (Drinking Water), Primary Contact Recreation (Swimming), and Secondary Contact Recreation (Boating), and any associated numeric or narrative water quality criteria. (Note that Public Water Supply performance is regulated through MassDEP’s Drinking Water program). Using Consolidated Assessment and Listing Methodology (CALM) guidance, data are compared to the Massachusetts SWQS and use attainment thresholds to determine if the designated uses are meeting criteria (Fully Supporting, or indicative of Good water quality conditions), not meeting criteria (Not Supporting, or indicative of Impaired water quality), or have Insufficient Information to determine water quality conditions. Causes and sources of any impairments are also identified. Completed restoration plans (such as Total Maximum Daily Load documents) are identified for the relevant waterbodies and impairments. Results of these evaluations are published in the biennial Integrated Report (IR), which addresses Sections 305(b), 314, and 303(d) of the Clean Water Act. Assessment and listing information contained in the IR is used to guide decisions concerning water resource management, protection, and restoration."
Missouri,
North Dakota,"As the lead water quality agency in the state of North Dakota, the North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality (formerly North Dakota Department of Health) has primary responsibility for the development, implementation and delivery of several Clean Water Act (CWA) programs, including water quality standards, Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs), Section 319 Nonpoint Source Pollution Management, and point source permitting. Under the CWA, the North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality is also responsible for lake, reservoir, river, stream and wetland monitoring and assessment and for reporting the condition of its surface waters every two years in a report referred to as the Integrated Sections 305(b) Water Quality Assessment Report and Section 303(d) List of Impaired Waters Needing TMDLs."
New Hampshire,"The New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services is responsible for assessing the health of New Hampshire’s waters. Water quality data is compared to the State’s surface water quality standards to determine which designated uses (i.e. swimming, aquatic life, …) are supported, which are not, and which uses cannot be assessed due to insufficient information. Those designated use support determinations are based on an evaluation and summary of the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of aquatic systems. This report helps the department to meet its goal to sustain a high quality of life for all citizens by protecting and restoring the environment and public health in New Hampshire."
Oklahoma,
Pennsylvania,"The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) is responsible for protecting and describing water quality status of the surface waters of Pennsylvania. Within PADEP, the Water Quality Division in the Bureau of Clean Water assesses the quality of streams, rivers, and lakes through routine and targeted monitoring of chemistry, biology, and physical habitat. These assessments describe whether the water meets water quality criteria (benchmarks or standards), fish are safe to eat, if levels of bacteria pose a higher risk for illness during swimming or boating, and if water is a good source of drinking water. These results are published every two years in the Pennsylvania Integrated Water Quality Monitoring and Assessment Report as required by Clean Water Act Sections 303(d) and 305(b)."
South Carolina,"There are two major components to SCDHEC's Ambient Surface Water Physical&Chemical Monitoring Program, including ongoing fixed-location monitoring and statewide statistical survey monitoring; each designed to provide data for water quality assessment of major water resource types at different spatial and temporal scales. See the.State of South Carolina Monitoring Strategy The fixed-location component of the monitoring network is comprised of Base Sites that are sampled monthly, year-round over an extended period of time, in a uniform manner to provide solid baseline data. Statistical Survey Sites are sampled once per month for one year and moved from year to year. The advantage of the statistical survey sampling design is that statistically valid statements (see above numbers) about the condition of the water resources of the State can be made about large areas based on a relatively small subsample. The SCDHEC Watershed Atlas is a web-based application that displays assessment summaries of these data for each monitoring location as well as other layers related to a variety of other Bureau of Water activities such as permitting and TMDL information."
South Dakota,"The South Dakota Department of Environment and Natural Resources (SD DENR) is responsible for monitoring, assessment and protection of the state’s water resources. Statewide monitoring and assessment efforts focus primarily on lakes, reservoirs, rivers and streams through various strategies and partnerships. Water quality data is used to make waterbody specific beneficial use support determinations and impairment decisions in accordance with state water quality standards and 303(d) listing methodologies. Assessment results are documented in South Dakota’s Integrated Report (IR) for Surface Water Quality. The Integrated Report provides a comprehensive account of water quality status including a list of impaired waterbodies that require Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) development. Results of this reporting serve as a tool for prioritization and implementation of nonpoint source pollution projects and other pollution control strategies necessary to bring impaired waterbodies into compliance. SD DENR also conducts random probabilistic surveys using state-level intensification following the National Aquatic Resource Survey framework. This survey design provides South Dakota with the ability to report condition of all lakes and streams in the state."
Virginia,The Department of Environmental Quality monitors water quality to answer key questions about water body health. The Probabilistic Monitoring Program is designed to answer the question: “What is the health of all of Virginia’s water bodies?” This program includes a set of randomly sampled water bodies that rotate on an annual basis intended to be representative of all Virginia waters. The Watershed Monitoring Program is designed to sample water bodies on a watershed scale in a 6-year assessment period. These data can help answer the question: “What is the health of my favorite water body?” The Trend Monitoring Program includes a network of sites on water bodies monitored over 20-year periods. This program can answer: “Has a particular Virginia water body shown an improving or degrading trend over the 20 year period?”
Wisconsin,"Water resources are the foundation for Wisconsin’s economy, environment, and quality of life. Wisconsin is a state rich with surface water, including lakes, streams, wetlands, aquifers and springs; there are thousands of streams stretching over 84,000 miles, more than one million acres of inland lakes, 1,000 miles of Great Lakes shoreline, and more than five million wetland acres. Every two years Wisconsin generates surface water quality assessments and a water quality report to Congress to fulfill the Clean Water Act reporting requirements for parts 303(d), 305(b), and 314. Surface water quality assessments use information gathered by DNR staff, partners, and volunteers to determine if a waters is meeting it's expected uses (fishing, boating, supporting aquatic life, safely eating fish). Impairment decisions are vetted by the regional biologists and sent out for public comment. "
Wyoming,"Wyoming is a headwaters state, straddles the Continental Divide, and provides the source of water to four major river basins of the West: the Missouri, the Colorado, the Great Basin, and the Columbia. There are approximately 280,000 miles of streams and 569,000 acres of lakes, reservoirs, and ponds in the state. The responsibility for assessing the quality of these waterbodies lies with the Water Quality Division (WQD) of the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality (WDEQ). Wyoming’s Surface Water Monitoring Strategy focuses on a rotating river basin framework where probabilistic and targeted designated use-support monitoring are integrated. Using this approach, probabilistic surveys are completed for each of five geographic divisions of the state (Bighorn/Yellowstone, Northeast, Green, Platte, and Bear/Snake) and the results of these surveys identify both high quality waters and waters where standards may not be attained as candidates for targeted designated use-support studies. The results of these water quality assessments are presented, biennially, in Wyoming’s Integrated 305(b) and 303(d) Report."
