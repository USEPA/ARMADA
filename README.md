## How to Launch the Tool
* To launch the tool locally, click the green 'Code' button and download the zip file which contains the code repository. Open the <b>app.R</b> file in RStudio for local app deployment. RStudio will recognize the Shiny script and provide a Run App button at the top of the editor pane (look for the green play triangle).

## Overview
The Partner Dashboard, aka Water Quality Dashboard, exports State/Territory/Tribe probability survey results from the [ATTAINS](https://www.epa.gov/waterdata/attains) Surveys module, combines data across survey years and displays the results in a user friendly data dashboard. The dashboard provides an overall picture of water quality condition across a state/territory/tribe or subpopulation by displaying the percentage of aquatic resources in different conditions for the most recent survey year available and the change from available survey years. Information presented are intended to assist states and the public to track progress in addressing water pollution, identify trends over time, recognize emerging problems and determine effectiveness of water management programs.

## Upload Survey Data

Each State/Territory/Tribe has a designated ATTAINS person with permission to transfer data to ATTAINS. If you cannot access the survey for an Organization, or if you need to be able to edit and submit survey results data, but currently only have Read Only rights, please contact your regional Data Management Coordinator (DMC) to have your permissions updated. Data Entry permissions will allow you to add and edit survey results data. Administrator permissions will allow you to add and edit survey results data, as well as finalize and publish the results. Survey
Administrators are limited to State/Territory/Tribal users. EPA users are allowed Survey Administrator permissions only in limited circumstances. Users can follow the document [How to Enter State Scale Statistical (Probability) Survey Results in ATTAINS](https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2019-05/documents/attains_how_to_enter_state_survey_results_2019-05-17.pdf) for a guide on entering survey data.

To learn how Survey data in ATTAINS is linked to the dashboard, visit: [How ATTAINS data is linked to the Water Quality Dashboard](https://github.com/USEPA/Partner-Dashboard/blob/main/ATTAINS_Dashboard_setup.pdf). Once data has been published in ATTAINS, it will be displayed in the dashboard on the fly. Simply edit and republish the survey data if you would like to make a change to the dashboard.
