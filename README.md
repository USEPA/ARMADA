# Partner Dashboard

## How to Launch the Dashboard
* You can visit the application here: https://rconnect-public.epa.gov/armada/. To launch the tool locally, click the green 'Code' button and download the zip file which contains the code repository. Open the <b>app.R</b> file in RStudio for local app deployment. RStudio will recognize the Shiny script and provide a Run App button at the top of the editor pane (look for the green play triangle).

## Overview
The Aquatic Resource Monitoring and Assessment Dashboard imports State/Territory/Tribe probability survey results from the [ATTAINS](https://www.epa.gov/waterdata/attains) Surveys module, combines data across survey years and displays the results in a user friendly data dashboard. The information presented is intended to assist states and the public in identifying the extent of waters that support healthy ecosystems, track progress in addressing water pollution, recognize emerging problems and determine effectiveness of water management programs. The methods states use to monitor and assess their waters - including what they monitor, how they monitor, and how they interpret and report their findings - vary from state to state and within individual states over time. Thus, the assessment decisions reported, while valuable for each state and Tribe individually, cannot be used to compare water quality conditions among states and Tribes or be combined to report national water quality conditions and trends or compare the impacts of specific causes or sources of impairment over time. 

## Upload Survey Data

Each State/Territory/Tribe has a designated ATTAINS person with permission to transfer data to ATTAINS. If you cannot access the survey for an Organization, or if you need to be able to edit and submit survey results data, but currently only have Read Only rights, please contact your regional Data Management Coordinator (DMC) to have your permissions updated. Data Entry permissions will allow you to add and edit survey results data. Administrator permissions will allow you to add and edit survey results data, as well as finalize and publish the results. Survey
Administrators are limited to State/Territory/Tribal users. EPA users are allowed Survey Administrator permissions only in limited circumstances. Users can follow the document [How to Enter State Scale Statistical (Probability) Survey Results in ATTAINS](https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2019-05/documents/attains_how_to_enter_state_survey_results_2019-05-17.pdf) for a guide on entering survey data.

To learn how Survey data in ATTAINS is linked to the dashboard, visit: [How ATTAINS data is linked to the Water Quality Dashboard](https://github.com/USEPA/Partner-Dashboard/blob/main/ATTAINS_Dashboard_setup.pdf). Once data has been published in ATTAINS, it will be displayed in the dashboard on the fly. Simply edit and republish the survey data if you would like to make a change to the dashboard.
